                A new collaboration between Drake‘s NOCTA line and Nike has been unveiled. Similar to its “Certified Lover Boy” and “Love You Forever” counterparts, the upcoming Air Force 1 Low is constructed with leather and arrives with a white base and complementing baby blue overlays. Branding spotted in the first-look imagery include the panel swoosh, an embroidered heel logo and the embossed “Love You Forever” on the white heel, while a baby blue outsole offers support and matching laces tie the shoe together for a sweet finish.

                Official images of the thirst-quenching Jarritos x Nike SB Dunk Low collaboration have surfaced. The kicks are pieced together with tear-away canvas overlays, bursts of green and orange accents that nod to Jarritos branding and insoles that are printed with all-over fruit graphics. Neither Nike or Jarritos have revealed any hard launch information, but as of now, these are expected to hit the market on May 6, 2023. The sneakers will also launch alongside a full Jarritos x Nike SB apparel collection that includes zip-up jackets, hoodies, tees and collared shirts. Additionally, Jarritos will release a limited series of bottles featuring a co-branded label featuring Mandarin, Pineapple, Fruit-punch, Lime and Mexican Cola flavors that will be used for seeding packages.

                New Balance continues to pay homage to the city of Boston. This time, the shoe brand has introduced a special edition colorway for Boston College with its New Balance 9060 silhouette. The shoe comes months after the brand announced the school-specific New Balance 550. Its second shoe dedicated to the school, the new colorway receives direct nods to the institutuion.

                The “Boston College” iteration for the New Balance 9060 sees the shoe constructed in a mixture of materials. Mostly constructed out of a light grey mesh upper and suede overlays, the school’s maroon undertones hit the “N” branded on the side as well as the inner lining and parts of the sole. The tongue is elevated in leather while the school’s “BC” logo is stitched on top. The insoles feature Boston College’s “Eagles” inscription to celebrate their mascot and inject a dose of school spirit, on-theme with the design.
